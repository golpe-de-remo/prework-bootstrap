======================

Task
----
So by now you are able to create React components :tada:

![Awesome](http://i.giphy.com/dkGhBWE3SyzXW.gif =100x100)

But they might be ugly as f*ck. In order to avoid it, in this prework we'll try to add some nice [responsive](http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/) styles.
So grab the code from the last exercise [prework-simple-list](https://github.com/golpe-de-remo/prework-simple-list) and apply some Material Bootstrap.
